	<h1>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h1>
	<br>
 
<p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair
showed how in typography, as <br> in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.</p>

<br>
 
<p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the <br> 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of<br> typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe <br> -- and show -- the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>
<br>
 
<p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with <br> type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the <br> principle element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a <br> designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and <br> is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply <br> eye-catching decoration.</p>
<br>
 
<p>Carl Dair's book "Design With Type" (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in <br> 1967) is deservedly still in print, even though the technology that he used and described has <br> long been outdated. The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer the practicalities <br> we have to deal with; but the visual relationships between letters, which Dair showed and <br> explained so graphically in his book, haven't changed at all. "Design With Type" is still one of <br> the best handbooks available for learning how to do exactly what the title says: design with <br> type.</p>
<br>
 
<p>At around the same time he was revising his book, Carl Dair was producing a series of six <br> pamphlets for West Virginia Pulp and Paper (Westvaco), which he called "A Typographic <br> Quest." Each booklet was, naturally, printed on Westvaco paper stock; like the lavish <br> paper-company samples produced today, this series was meant to raise the profile of the <br> manufacturer and encourage designers to think of Westvaco when specifying paper for their <br> printing jobs. But these were quite modest productions: little saddlestitched booklets of about <br> 30 pages, measuring 5-1/4 inches by 9, usually printed in two colors (the first one uses three <br> colors throughout; the later ones are two-color, although the second color may change from <br> sheet to sheet, with all three colors used together on the covers). The first "A Typographic <br> Quest" was published in 1964; the sixth (and, as far as I know, final) came out in 1968, the year <br> Carl Dair died. Since he was both writer and designer for the series, each of the booklets <br>emerged as a wholly crafted object, dedicated to explaining one or another aspect of using <br> type.</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2>
<br>
 
<p>The heart of Carl Dair's teaching -- the thing that I keep pointing people to, and the most <br> valuable thing I myself learned from his work -- is the subject of "A Typographic Quest" No. 5: <br> "Typographic Contrast." In a virtuoso performance, Dair shows exactly how designers use <br> different kinds of visual contrast to make design work and meaning pop out -- clearly and <br> unambiguously, and with flair. To make his point, he compares typography to music.</p>
<br>
 
Graphic form and musical form have a common denominator: rhythm and emphasis, harmony <br> and contrast. "Harmony and contrast," says Dair, "are fundamental to both, and the discovery <br> of these basic principles and their application to the design of printed matter is the object of <br> this volume of 'A Typographic Quest.'"
<br>
 
<h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>
<br>
 
<p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black <br> strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or <br> decorations being similar in style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of<br> contrast. He emphasizes that in any kind of differentiation, it's important to make the contrast <br> obvious -- not just a slight change, an almost imperceptible variation, but a really big, obvious <br> difference between the contrasting elements.</p>
<br>
 
<p>Contrast of Size<br>
Contrast of Weight<br>
Contrast of Form<br>
Contrast of Structure<br>
Contrast of Texture<br>
Contrast of Color<br>
Contrast of Direction<br>
Other Types of Contrast</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Contrast of Size</h2>
<br>
 
<p>The first and most basic contrast is size. "A simple but dramatic contrast of size," says Dair,<br> "provides a point to which the reader's attention is drawn. Set in the same style of type, it <br> maintains the exact relationship of the letter to the background. It is only a physical <br> enlargement of the basic pattern created by the form and the weight of the type being used <br> for the text." The most common use of size is in making the title or heading noticeably bigger <br> than the text -- but that's only a starting-point.</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Contrast of Weight</h2>
<br>
 
<p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight: bold type stands out in the middle of lighter <br> type of the same style. As Dair points out, "Not only types of varying weight, but other <br> typographic material such as rules, spots, squares, etc., can be called into service to provide a <br> heavy area for a powerful point of visual attraction or emphasis."</p>

<br>
 
<p>The next two kinds of contrast are the contrast of form and the contrast of structure. It's not <br> entirely obvious where to draw a line between these two, since they both have to do with the <br> shapes of the letters.</p>
<br>
 
 
<h2>Contrast of Form</h2>
<br>
 
<p>By "form," Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and its lowercase equivalent, or <br> a roman letter and its italic variant. He includes condensed and expanded versions under <br> "form," and he even allows as how "there are some script types which harmonize with <br> standard types, such as the Bank Script and Bodoni on the opposite page, and can be used for <br> dramatic change of form." (He warns, parenthetically, against using scripts and italics <br> together, since they are both versions of handwritten letters; they're more likely to conflict than <br> to contrast.)</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Contrast of Structure</h2>
<br>
 
<p>By "structure," Dair means the different letterforms of different kinds of typefaces -- a <br> monoline sans serif vs. a high-contrast modern, for instance, or an italic vs. a blackletter. "The <br> use of contrast of structure may be compared to an orator who changes his voice not to <br> increase or decrease the volume, but to change the very quality of his voice to suit his words."</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Contrast of Texture</h2>
 
<p>Put all these things together, and apply them to a block of text on a page, and you come to the <br> contrast of texture: the way the lines of type look as a mass, which depends partly on the <br> letterforms themselves and partly on how they're arranged. "Like threads in cloth," says Dair, <br> "types form the fabric of our daily communication."</p>
<br> 
 
 
<h2>Contrast of Color</h2>
<br> 
 
<p>Dair's sixth contrast is color -- and he warns that a second color is usually less emphatic than <br> plain black on white (or white on black), so it's important to give careful thought to which <br> element needs to be emphasized, and to pay attention to the tonal values of the colors used.</p>
<br> 
<h2>Contrast of Direction</h2>
<br>
 
<p>The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction: the opposition between vertical and horizontal, and the angles in between. <br> Turning one word on its side can have a <br>dramatic effect on a layout. But Dair points out that text blocks also have their vertical or <br> horizontal aspects, and mixing wide blocks of long lines with tall columns of short lines can <br> also produce a contrast.</p>
<br>
 
<h2>Other Types of Contrast</h2>
<br>
 
<p>There are other kinds of contrast, less clearly dependent on the type itself. Dair mentions <br> "contrast by isolation," i.e., putting a word or phrase in an isolated position away from the <br> other elements on the page, to make it stand out. (I think of this as a contrast of position.) <br> And he suggests other kinds of non-typographic contrast, such as mixing paper stocks, <br> embossing, and using contrasting matte or gloss inks. He also points out that illustrations, <br> especially line art, may be in harmony with the type on the same page or may contrast with it <br> completely.</p>

<br>
 
<p>Finally, Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm ("in typography, it consists of intervals of <br> space") and about the power of "interrupted rhythm" ("the impact derives not from the fact <br> that the unexpected happens, but rather that the expected does not happen").</p>
<br>
 
<p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together, in order to make the <br> differences between visual elements even more obvious. We can use all of Dair's seven kinds <br> of contrast at once, if we're skillful; he refers to this as typographic "chords." (One of the <br> chapter titles in "Design With Type" is "Multiplying the Contrasts.") But breaking them down <br> like this into simple oppositions makes it easier to use them consciously; it keeps us from <br> getting our layouts all muddied up through trying to change too many things at once without <br>  thinking about what we're doing. I've found Carl Dair's analysis of typographic contrast -- and <br> especially the visual flair with which he presents it -- an invaluable tool in the practice of <br> graphic design.</p>
